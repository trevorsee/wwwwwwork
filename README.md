Let the computer do the creative work â€“ then you can focus on the rest. Often the best ideas are forced connections between unrelated things. That isn't something that humans are great at; but computers are!

### instructions
Keep a running list of words, phrases, ideas, and topics that you are interested in. They will be saved to your browser's local cache. When you are stuck or need an idea click combine until you draw an interesting connection.

### collaborative slippage

1. Humans (sometimes) collaborate with each other, tools, systems...
2. Miscommunication and misread signals are critical to emergent ideas
3. Who is the author? Are there new ideas?
4. How can the qualities of automation and machines be engaged with for creativity.
